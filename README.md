# 🛍️ Intelligent eCommerce Platform  
### End-to-End Data Engineering + Analytics + ML Project

This repository contains a full **data engineering and machine learning project** simulating an intelligent eCommerce analytics platform.  
The goal is to demonstrate skills across:

- **Data Ingestion** (Sentinel-style logs)
- **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- **ETL Pipelines** in Python
- **Data Modeling** for analytics
- **Serving Layer** using SQLite
- **Machine Learning** (customer churn scoring)
- **Dashboarding** using Bootstrap + Chart.js

All data is **synthetic** and safe for public GitHub use.  
This project is designed to be portfolio-ready and useful for interviews, assignments, and showcasing real-world engineering workflows.
